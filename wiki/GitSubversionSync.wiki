#summary How I sync PyWebKitGtk git repos into Google Code repository
#labels Phase-Implementation

Most of the development of PyWebKitGtk happen in Git. API updates, bug fixes and general house cleaning - all of it happen in Git. But having said that, I also like the idea that I'm not enforcing a particular version control system to its users and developers. Hence, this is why I always try to update the Subversion repository hosted in Google Code everytime I _push_ changes to its Git repo.

How do I sync my git repo to subversion? Easy. Courtesy of Google, they provided us a guide on how to do it. The howto can be found at [http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/ImportingFromGit Google Code - Importing From Git].

So really, there is no difference between the Git repos and the Subversion repo in terms of 
_mainline_ changes. But in terms of tags and branches, those happen in Git because it's easier for me to maintain those in Git than in Subversion.

* Mainline is what HEAD is, or trunk in Subversion parlance.
